“Team culture:
 They had a cohesive team approach to problem-solving and process improvement.
Expectations:
 They didn’t envision automation being the magic answer to all their problems; they set their expectations appropriately for what it could deliver as well as its limitations.
Timing:
 They knew what tools were appropriate based on the product’s maturity and lifecycle.
Infrastructure:
 They had the correct infrastructure in place to allow them to get the most out of their automation efforts.”

Three main factors that led to automation being more efficient than manual testing:


- The automated test case is expected to have a relatively long life without needing to be changed or edited.

- The test case is comparatively easy to automate, i.e., it can be created from a generalized manual process; the more complex the task, the more difficult it is to automate.

- The comparative cost of automating is lower than that of executing the test manually.”


Summary
“Automating all your testing isn’t a silver bullet and can be counterproductive if implemented in the wrong way.
The question “Can we automate everything?” can be answered by looking at the two main types of testing activities:

- Investigating
 activities require a human to uncover new information

- Verifying
 activities confirm whether the information you expect is true or not and can be performed by a human or a machine

To answer the question “Should you automate everything?” there are three factors that you should consider:

- Length of time for which the automated test is expected to be used (the longer, the better)

- The comparative ease of automating the task or process

- The comparative cost of automating being less than that of executing the test manually”
