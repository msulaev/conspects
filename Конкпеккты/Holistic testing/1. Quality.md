*Quality is value to some person.*

#### Approaches to quality

- Process quality
 In the development cycle, the emphasis is on the quality of the practices followed to build the product. The focus is on defect prevention and limiting rework. Teams often target testing with this perspective.
 
- Product-based quality
“People often assume that using good ingredients should make a good product. If quality is viewed as an inherent characteristic of goods, higher quality means better performance, and enhanced features. This thinking may be slightly flawed. Using the metaphor of cooking, an ordinary cook with good ingredients may not have a good outcome, but a great chef with ordinary ingredients may produce something magical. Teams need to understand what their product is and how it is constructed.”

- User-based quality

The user-based perspective is often used in conversations about quality, and it is highly subjective and highly personal.


We often think about quality as costing something - extra processes, extra work. But a lack of quality may be far more expensive if we don’t consider both tangible and intangible costs. There is loss of opportunity, or erosion of trust and reputation. Once lost, these intangibles are hard to get back. Start by analyzing and understanding your risks. That is where your most valuable testing begins.
