When teams work together with product folks, designers, and others in the discovery and planning activities, they start to build shared understanding. Once the high-level picture is established, it’s time to encapsulate that shared understanding in artifacts that help build the right thing. In our experience, there are a few factors to succeed with this effort

#### Discover:
Product people engage in discovery activities to determine what value a particular feature offers to their customers and the organization, and what that might look like. They test the idea to see if it is worth pursuing, and if it fits the company’s goals and vision. Techniques like Impact Mapping can help organizations. Delivery team members may also work with customers, sit in on sales calls, and take part in other activities to better understand user needs. They contribute their ideas and questions during discovery sessions.

#### Plan

In the planning stage, the delivery team can show their strength by asking relevant questions, and offering suggestions based on their own experiences, system understanding, and domain knowledge. Your strategy may include all or only some of the following approaches depending on your context, level of product understanding, access to customers, or the type of product your team is working on.

### Vizialization
Once the big picture is known, teams plan in more detail. Identifying risks is a big part of the added value. We also find visual tools helpful for brainstorming about risks. Mind maps are useful for this as well. Another technique we’ve liked is risk storming developed by Baren van Deale. This process involves the following steps:
- Prioritize up to six quality attributes for the product or feature being planned
- Brainstorm risks for each quality attribute, one risk per sticky note
- Use the risk storming card deck to get ideas for ways to mitigate each risk
- The information captured can be used to help plan a testing strategy

*Testing early includes testing assumptions*
