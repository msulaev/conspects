In modern software development, testing is not a phase that happens after coding is finished. Testing is one of the many activities in software development, along with coding, planning, design, architecture, operations, and more”
“For example, as they’re building a new feature, the team may realize information is missing, or even discover that the feature idea is flawed. It’s time to go back to the planning or discovery stage. Maybe they deploy a new change to a test environment and see unexpected behavior and go back to the building or understanding stage to fix whatever is needed. The focus is on fast feedback throughout, although the picture doesn’t show that

The left side of the loop shows testing activities that can be completed early in the cycle. These focus on creating shared understanding to guide development and prevent defects. The right side of the loop is about testing what was built and finding defects that escaped the build process. It’s also for learning from customer usage and gathering data to help plan the next changes.

### Stages

- Discovery : Activities here might include product managers talking with customers to see if a feature is worth pursuing. Delivery team members may challenge the new ideas, point out risks, and raise questions to help the business to make decisions. UX designers may do some research in the field to help decide the feasibility.”

- Plan: This is the time to advocate for testable stories and flush out hidden assumptions. Teams may start specifying high level acceptance tests and gain a big picture understanding of the stories. Organizations with multiple teams may organize sessions where different teams discuss dependencies and how they will be managed.

- Understand: Having planned features, stories, and other changes at a high level in the planning stage, the goal in this stage is to build shared understanding of the story details. This starts the iterative cycle of working on, and delivering user stories, a process which will continue in the building and deploying stages that follow. Practices like acceptance test-driven development or behaviour-driven development are part of understanding the stories. Teams may involve user experience experts to learn about customer needs. Programmers may help by creating low-fidelity prototypes for fast, iterative feedback. When having conversations regarding different quality attributes, such as performance, reliability, or security (just to name a few), consider what data or tools they may need for testing those attributes. This is the time to plan what data and events to log for later monitoring and observability.
- Build: This is when the team implements user stories and features. As they write code for the new changes, the team instruments the code to capture the data and events as planned in previous stages. It’s important to add the telemetry in this stage, so the team can test that the log files, monitoring dashboards and observability tools have all the necessary information for production use. Teams may perform exploratory testing at the story level to uncover what they didn’t think about when they were developing. While engaging in these different activities during the build stage, they may learn new information and revisit some earlier decisions. As organizations transition to virtual and cloud infrastructures, teams can spin up test environments on demand. This can simplify testing some of the quality attributes, such as load or performance testing. Deploying to a production-like environment is a common practice for testing the system
- Deploy: Many teams still struggle to have stable test environments. When that’s the case, an automated deployment to a development environment and running a smoke test is a good first step.
- Release: There are many different mechanisms for releasing to customers. Release strategies can provide ways to safely test in production environments when that is appropriate
- Observe: If the team has instrumented their code to capture events and traces that enable them to detect and understand production problems quickly, they are practicing observability
- Learn: As teams observe how customers use their product, they can hypothesize about how to improve it. Testing is a big part of this learning. Resulting ideas and experiments feed into the next discovery sessions


### Summary
### 1. Основные компоненты модели

- **Качество как коллективная ответственность:** вся команда, включая разработчиков, тестировщиков, аналитиков, дизайнеров и операционных специалистов, работает вместе ради качества.
    
- **Многоуровневое тестирование:** тестирование ведётся на разных уровнях — от юнит-тестов до интеграционного, системного и приёмочного тестирования, а также мониторинга в продакшене.
    
- **Интеграция автоматизации и ручного тестирования:** автоматизация покрывает регрессию и повторяющиеся проверки, ручное исследовательское тестирование выявляет новые и сложные баги.
    
- **Непрерывный процесс:** тестирование не отделено от разработки, а встроено в цикл создания продукта — от планирования до релиза и дальнейшей поддержки.
    

### 2. Ключевые практики Holistic Testing

- **Совместное уточнение требований:** использование методов Specification by Example, BDD для общего понимания критериев качества.
    
- **Ранняя и частая обратная связь:** регулярное тестирование и демонстрации прогресса помогают быстро выявлять проблемы.
    
- **Использование визуальных техник:** story mapping, example mapping помогают структурировать тест-кейсы и планирование.
    
- **Внедрение метрик и анализа:** сбор данных о качестве, дефектах и производительности для улучшения процесса.
    

### 3. Цели модели

- Создать **прозрачность качества** на всех этапах.
    
- Повысить **скорость обнаружения и устранения проблем**.
    
- Обеспечить **устойчивое качество продукта** на протяжении всего жизненного цикла.
    
- Вовлечь всю команду в **постоянное улучшение**.
