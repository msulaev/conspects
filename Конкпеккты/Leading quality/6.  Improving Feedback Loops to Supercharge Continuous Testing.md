How can we speed up delivery, be more productive, make our lives easier, and move our philosophy of quality from playing a bit part to being the foundation of our culture?

If there were only one test we could run, which would it be?
By asking that question at each testing iteration, the team prioritized tests by how much value each delivered to the engineer at that time. This enabled them to identify a set of smaller automation tests that they could run in under ten minutes and earlier in their development pipeline to give the engineers faster feedback, so as to gauge if something critical had broken or not.

Jones’ research indicates that upwards of 85% of bugs are introduced in the design and build phases of development, sometimes even before a line of code has been written. A bug found post-release could cost $16,000 or more to address. Yet that same bug could have been remedied in these early stages for as little as $25.42”

The earlier you can identify and address a problem, the more time and effort it will save you in the long run. That’s why it’s so important to have the mindset that “continuous testing” applies throughout the development cycle.
Once we are clear that quality teams can help by continuously testing at any point in time,43
 we are able to start working out how to get the most out of different testing approaches.


##### feedback loop

As she points out, the feedback loop is different for each of these tests. They have different costs and response times, and return different types of information. A unit test, for example, could quickly return a pass/fail answer, but it couldn’t tell much beyond that. Some forms of exploratory testing could take multiple days, but would provide a wealth of insight. Although it would take longer to provide feedback, this doesn’t discount its value. Different approaches solve different problems.
Once you have the right feedback loops in place giving you relevant information about the quality of your product, the next step is to work out how to get the information as quickly as possible.


##### optimizations for feedback loops

- Prioritize Value over Speed
Even though this section is about improving your feedback loops, that doesn’t just mean speeding them up. Focusing on the value you get from the feedback can be more important than the speed. It doesn’t matter how quickly you can deliver testing results if you’re not providing the engineers with the information they need.”

- Run Tests Simultaneously to Increase Scale
If you have ten tests that you run one after the other, the fastest way to improve the speed of the tests is to be able to run them all at the same time. This would mean your total testing time would only be as long as your longest test, as opposed to the length of all the tests added together.

- Learn through Continuous Improvement
How can teams learn from the past in order to move even faster in the future?
Taking the time to look back on a process to identify the root cause of an issue is called a retrospective. While interviewing Abby Bangser, a senior testing engineer at the online printing company MOO, she told us, “I don’t just care about the bug. I want to know where and how that bug was found, what led to its introduction in the first place, and how we can make sure it doesn’t happen again.”
Abby doesn’t just want to find existing bugs; she wants to prevent the same mistakes from happening twice. This reduces the potential for similar bugs to be introduced in the future.
It could be that a release went out without sufficient testing of a key area of your app. Addressing that blind spot would help avoid the same types of bugs occurring in future builds, while eliminating the need for additional iterations altogether.”

- Create Infrastructure That Leverages the Team
 They actively look for tools that will allow them to spend more time on high-value activities and less on low-impact tasks.
No matter where your testing is, there are opportunities to improve in all four of these areas. From testing to ensure you’re delivering customer value, to making certain a line of an engineer’s code does what it was intended to, you can always optimize. And the best way to see the places where there is scope for improvement is to map out your development pipeline and identify what feedback is needed where.
However, feedback loops are a wasted opportunity without the correct infrastructure in place to take advantage of them. In the next chapter, we outline the most effective methods of utilizing feedback, and how best to prepare your team.


##### summary
- In order to provide true continuous testing, you need to test a product at every stage of its lifecycle, from the initial concept through to testing in production and every point in between.
- Have a clear understanding of your development pipeline to know what feedback you need to provide to the engineering team at each stage.
- Knowing what information you want from a test determines the type of testing you choose to do.
- Each testing type has its own feedback loop that has unique information, costs, and response times.
- Having worked with some of the best engineering teams in the world, we’ve observed that optimizing feedback revolves around four key areas:
	- Prioritize value over speed.
	- Run tests simultaneously to increase scale.
	- Learn through continuous improvement.
	- Create infrastructure that leverages the team.”
